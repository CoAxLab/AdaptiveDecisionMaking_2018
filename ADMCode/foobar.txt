Now let's evaluate the performance of the model using two metrics:

<br>

**Payoff (P)** is the degree to which the agent chooses the High Value decks over the Low Value decks. This is a measure of efficient value-based decision-making.

P = $\Sigma (C + D) - \Sigma (A + B)$

**Sensitivity (Q)** is the sensitivity of the agent to High Frequency rewards over Low Frequency rewards.

Q = $\Sigma (B + D) - \Sigma (A + C)$
